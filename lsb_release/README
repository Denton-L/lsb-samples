This directory contains:

src - directory containing the source for lsb_release 
lsb-release.spec - the spec file for generating RPM packages for lsb_release
debian - directory containing the necessary configuration files for
         generating a deb packages for lsb_release


Generating a release
--------------------

1. Checkout a tagged release (eg Release_1_1) or a snapshot

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.lsb.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lsb export lsb_release Release_1_1

2. Choose a version number (example commands following will assume
1.1) and rename the src directory appropriately.

cd lsb_release
mv src lsb-release-1.1

3a. Create the tarball release

tar cvfz lsb-release-1.1.tar.gz lsb-release-1.1

3b. Create the rpm release

i. Create a tarball

tar cvfz lsb-release-1.1.tgz lsb-release-1.1

ii. Modify the spec file appropriately (if the version number has
changed, change the Version and Source fields). These changes should
later be checked into CVS.

iii. Build the source and binary RPM package (exact details may vary
if not building on a Red Hat system)

cp lsb_release.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
mv lsb-release-1.1.tgz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
rpm -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/lsb_release.spec

This should result in the following files being generated:

/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/lsb-release-1.1-1.noarch.rpm
/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/lsb-release-1.1-1.src.rpm

3c. Create the deb package release

i. Move the debian directory into the renamed src directory

mv debian lsb-release-1.1

ii. Update the changelog file in the debian directory

iii. Build the debian packages

cd lsb-release-1.1
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

4. Upload the various release files to the Source Forge site.
